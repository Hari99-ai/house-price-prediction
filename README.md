House Price Prediction

📌 Overview

This project is a House Price Prediction System built using Machine Learning. It utilizes a regression model to estimate house prices based on features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. The project is deployed using Flask and provides a simple web interface for users to input data and get predictions.



🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for modeling.

Machine Learning Model: Uses regression algorithms to predict house prices.

Web Application: User-friendly interface using Flask.

Model Deployment: Integrated ML model into a web application.

Interactive Input Form: Users can enter property details and get predictions.

📊 Machine Learning Model

Dataset: The model is trained on a real estate dataset containing multiple house features.

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest .

Model Training: The model.py script preprocesses data and trains the model.

Model Deployment: The trained model (model.pkl) is loaded into the Flask app.
